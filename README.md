# WallpaperChanger

- ## Educational Use Only

This script is designed for educational institutions where students frequently change their wallpaper. By using the [`start.bat`](https://github.com/notthecoolguyyouknow/WallpaperChanger/blob/main/start.bat) script, you can ensure that the wallpaper is reset to a consistent image upon startup and change.

- ## Overview

  **[`start.bat`](https://github.com/notthecoolguyyouknow/WallpaperChanger/blob/main/start.bat)**: This file serves as the "installer." It downloads the `.ps1` script to Temp on the system to prevent students from deleting it. Also makes a directory for the configuration. Which is used on the `.ps1` script.

  The shorter link for the [`start.bat`](https://github.com/notthecoolguyyouknow/WallpaperChanger/blob/main/start.bat) is `http://wallpaper301.gedagediga.lol` (Thanks [`iakzs`](https://github.com/iakzs) for the domain)

### TODO
- ~~Add customization for the links on start.bat 1st run.~~
- Logging system to see who tried to change the wallpaper.
- ~~Be checking for every wallpaper change instead of on startup.~~
- Allowing extensions. (For more features, and all following the [Important Notice](https://github.com/notthecoolguyyouknow/WallpaperChanger/blob/main/README.md#important-notice))
